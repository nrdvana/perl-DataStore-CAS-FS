- Switched to a 3-decimal version string.

- Renamed accessors in Path objects from 'path_ent*' to 'path_dirent*',
  and 'final_ent' to 'dirent'.  This is an API change, but I don't think
  anyone is using this module yet anyway.

- Added $path->resolved_canonical_path convenience method to quickly get a
  unix path string like "/a/b/c" from a $path object.
  (mostly useful for filters)  Also added ->canonical_path for a quick
  rendering of the path that was passed to it.

- Added other helpful accessors for path objects: 'type', 'name', 'depth'.
  Added new methods 'mkdir', 'path_if_exists'.

- Enhanced path resolving, so that a resolved path which you request a
  subpath from will return a partially-resolved path object, speeding up
  the "for($path->readdir) { $path->path($_) }" pattern.

- Added $fs->get_dir_entries, $fs->readdir, and $path->readdir, which return
  a list of directory entries *including* the current un-committed overrides.

- Added $fs->tree_iterator, and $path->tree_iterator, which runs a similar
  operation to the unix 'find' command on the virtual filesystem.

- Fixed the $fs->unlink feature, which was completely broken before, and added
  test cases.

- Changed version numbers to strings (used integers by accident)

- Many fixes in POD notation, and documentation in general.

- Removed reference to Carp::Always (was only for debugging)

- Fixed bug in testcase code where I was blessing a reference to a constant
  string.  Some perl versions didn't like this.

- Initial version.  Directory encoding and decoding is fully functional,
  resolve_path works well, and set_path and update_path seem to be working.
