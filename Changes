0.0101   2013-05-03

- Changed version numbers to strings (used integers by accident)

- Many fixes in POD notation, and documentation in general.

- Removed reference to Carp::Always (was only for debugging)

- Fixed bug in testcase code where I was blessing a reference to a constant
  string.  Some perl versions didn't like this.

0.0100   2013-05-01

- Initial version.  Directory encoding and decoding is fully functional,
  resolve_path works well, and set_path and update_path seem to be working.
