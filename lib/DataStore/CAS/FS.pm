# ABSTRACT: Virtual Filesystem backed by Content-Addressable Storage

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Create a new empty filesystem
  my $casfs= DataStore::CAS::FS->new(
    store => DataStore::CAS::Simple->new(
      path => './foo/bar',
      create => 1,
      digest => 'SHA-256'
    )
  );
  
  # Open an existing root directory on an existing store
  $casfs= DataStore::CAS::FS->new( store => $cas, root => $digest_hash );
  
  # --- These pass through to the $cas module
  
  $hash= $casfs->put("Blah");
  $hash= $casfs->put_file("./foo/bar/baz");
  $file= $casfs->get($hash);
  
  # Open a path within the filesystem
  $handle= $casfs->path('1','2','3','myfile')->open;
  
  # Make some changes
  $casfs->apply_path(['1', '2', 'myfile'], { ref => $some_new_file });
  $casfs->apply_path(['1', '2', 'myfile_copy'], { ref => $some_new_file });
  # Commit them
  $casfs->commit();
  
=head1 DESCRIPTION

DataStore::CAS::FS extends the L<DataStore::CAS> API to support directory
objects which let you store store traditional file hierarchies in the CAS,
and look up files by a path name (so long as you know the hash of the root).

The methods provided allow you to traverse the virtual directory hierarchy,
make changes to it, and commit the changes to create a new filesystem
snapshot.  The L<DataStore::CAS> backend provides readable and seekable file
handles.  There is *not* any support for access control, since those
concepts are system dependent.  The module DataStore::CAS::FS::Fuse (not yet
written) will have an implementation of permission checking appropriate for
Unix.

The directories can contain arbitrary metadata, making them suitable for
backing up filesystems from Unix, Windows, or other environments.
You can also pick directory encoding plugins to more efficiently encode
just the metadata you care about.

Each directory is serialized into a file which is stored in the CAS like any
other, resulting in a very clean implementation.  You cannot determine whether
a file is a directory or not without the context of the containing directory,
and you need to know the digest hash of the root directory in order to browse
the full filesystem.  On the up side, you can store any number of filesystems
in one CAS by maintaining a list of roots.

The root's digest hash is affected by all the content of the entire tree, so
the root hash will change each time you alter any directory in the tree.  But,
any unchanged files in that tree will be re-used, since they still have the
same digest hash.  You can see great applications of this design in a number
of version control systems, notably Git.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=head2 store

Read-only.  An instance of a class implementing L<DataStore::CAS>.

=head2 root_entry

A L<DataStore::CAS::DirEnt> object describing the root of the tree.
Must be of type "dir".  Should have a name of "", but not required.
You can pick an arbitrary directory for a chroot-like-effect, but beware
of broken symlinks.

C<root_entry> refers to an **immutable** directory.  If you make in-memory
overrides to the filesystem using C<apply_path> or the various convenience
methods, C<root_entry> will continue to refer to the original static
filesystem. If you then C<commit()> those changes, C<root_entry> will be
updated to refer to the new filesystem.

You can create a list of filesystem snapshots by saving a copy of root_entry
each time you call C<commit()>.  They will all continue to exist within the
CAS.  Cleaning up the CAS is left as an exercise for the reader. (though
utility methods to help with this are in the works)

=head2 case_insensitive

Read-only.  Defaults to false.  If set to true in the constructor, this causes
all directory entries to be compared in a case-insensitive manner, and all
directory objects to be loaded with case-insensitive lookup indexes.

=head2 hash_of_null

Read-only.  Passes through to store->hash_of_null

=head2 hash_of_empty_dir

This returns the canonical digest hash for an empty directory.
In other words, the return value of

  put_scalar( DataStore::CAS::FS::DirCodec::Minimal->encode([],{}) ).

This value is cached for performance.

It is possible to encode empty directories with any plugin, so not all empty
directories will have this key, but any time the library knows it is writing
an empty directory, it will use this value instead of recalculating the hash
of an empty dir.

=head2 dir_cache

Read-only.  A DataStore::CAS::FS::DirCache object which holds onto recently
used directory objects.  This object can be used in multiple CAS::FS objects
to make the most of the cache.

An instance of L<DataStore::CAS::FS::DirEnt>, or a hashref of DirEnt fields,
or an empty hash if you want to start from an empty filesystem, or a

sub get {

=head2 get_dir

  $dir= $fs->get_dir( $digest_hash_or_File, \%optional_flags );

This returns a de-serialized directory object found by its hash.  It is a
shorthand for 'get' on the Store, and deserializing enough of the result to
create a usable L<Dir|DataStore::CAS::FS::Dir> object (or subclass).

Also, this method caches recently used directory objects, since they are
immutable. (but woe to those who break the API and modify their directory
objects!)

Returns undef if the digest hash isn't in the store, but dies if an error
occurs while decoding one that exists.

=head2 path

  $path= $fs->path( @path_names )

Returns a L<DataStore::CAS::FS::Path|/"PATH OBJECTS"> object which provides
frendly object-oriented access to several other methods of CAS::FS. This
object does *nothing* other than curry parameters, for your convenience.
In particular, the path isn't resolved until you try to use it, and might not
be valid.

See L</resolve_path> for notes about @path_names.  Especially note that your
path needs to start with the volume name, which will usually be ''.  Note that
you get this already if you take an absolute path and pass it to
L<< File::Spec-E<gt>splitdir|File::Spec/splitdir >>.

=cut

sub path {
	bless { filesystem => (shift), path_names => [ map { File::Spec->splitdir($_) } @_ ] },
		'DataStore::CAS::FS::Path';
}

=head2 path_if_exists

  $path= $fs->path_if_exists( @path_names )

This method is like L</path>, but it immediately resolves the path and returns
undef if the path doesn't exist.  It returns the L<path object|/"PATH OBJECTS">
if it does.

=cut

sub path_if_exists {
	my $self= shift;
	my $path= $self->path(@_);
	$path->resolve({no_die => 1})? $path : undef;
}

=head2 tree_iterator

  $iter= $fs->tree_iterator( %optional_flags )

With no flags, creates a L<tree-iterator|/"TREE ITERATORS"> which iterates the
entire tree depth-first, listing directories before their contents.

When the C<path> flag is given, iterates the named path and everything
under it (if it is a directory), or croaks if it doesn't exist.

=cut

sub tree_iterator {
	my $self= shift;
	my %p= (@_ == 1 && ref $_[0] eq 'HASH')? %{$_[0]} : @_;
	return DataStore::CAS::FS::TreeIterator->new(
		path => [],
		%p,
		fs => $self
	);
}


=head2 resolve_path

  $path_array= $fs->resolve_path( \@path_names, \%optional_flags )
  $path_array= $fs->resolve_path( $path_string, \%optional_flags )

Returns an arrayref of L<DirEnt|DataStore::CAS::FS::DirEnt> objects
corresponding to the canonical absolute specified path, starting with the
C<root_entry>.

@path_names may contain empty strings C<"">, which are ignored.  This provides
compatibility with L<File::Spec-E<gt>splitdir|File::Spec/splitdir>, and also
with calling C<split /\//> on strings with "//" in them.

If a C<$path_string> is given instead of an arrayref, it will be split by
L<File::Spec-E<gt>splitdir|File::Spec/splitdir>, which may or may not be what
you want.

When resolving symlinks, this function operates much the same way Linux does.
If the path you specify ends with a symlink, the result will be a DirEnt
describing the symlink.  If the path you specify ends with a symlink and a
C<""> (equivalent of ending with a C<'/'> or C<'/.'>), the symlink will be
resolved to a L<DirEnt|DataStore::CAS::FS::DirEnt> for the target file or
directory. (and if the target doesn't exist, it throws an exception, but see
C<nodie>)

Also, its worth noting that the directory objects in DataStore::CAS::FS are
strictly a tree, with no back-reference to the parent directory.  So, ".."
in the path will be resolved by removing one element from the path.  HOWEVER,
this still gives you a kernel-style resolve (rather than a shell-style resolve)
because if you specify "/1/foo/.." and foo is a symlink to "/1/2/3",
the ".." will back you up to "/1/2/" and not "/1/".

The tree-with-no-parent-reference design is also why we return an array of
the entire path, since you can't take a final directory and trace it backwards.

If the path does not exist, or cannot be resolved for some reason, this method
will either return undef or die, based on whether you provided the optional
C<nodie> flag.

Flags:

=over

=item C<no_die => $bool>

Return undef instead of dying

=item C<error_out => \$err_variable>

If set to a scalar-ref, the scalar ref will receive the error message, if any.
You probably want to set 'nodie' as well.

=item C<partial => $bool>

If the path doesn't exist, any missing directories will be given placeholder
DirEnt objects.  You can test whether the path was resolved completely by
checking whether $result->[-1]->type is defined.

=item C<mkdir => 1 || 2>

If mkdir is 1, missing directories will be created on demand.

If mkdir is 2,

=head2 get_dir_entries

This differs from C<$fs-E<gt>path(@path)-E<gt>dir-E<gt>iterator> in that you
see any changes that have been made via calls to C<set_path> or C<apply_path>.
Calling C<iterator> on the directory object will only return what was recorded

=head2 set_path

  $fs->set_path( \@path, $Dir_Entry \%optional_flags )
  # returns 1, or dies

Temporarily override a directory entry at @path.  If $Dir_Entry is false, this
will cause @path to be unlinked.  If the name of Dir_Entry differs from the
final component of @path, it will act like a rename (which is the same as just
unlinking the old path and creating the new path)  If Dir_Entry is missing a
name, it will default to the final element of @path.

C<path> may be either an arrayref of names, or a string which will be split by
L<File::Spec>.

$Dir_Entry is either an instance of L<DataStore::CAS::FS::DirEnt>, or a
hashref of the fields to create one.

No fields of the old dir entry are used; if you want to preserve some of them,
you need to do that yourself (see L<clone|DataStore::CAS::FS::DirEnt/clone>)
or use the C<update_path()> method.

If @path refers to nonexistent directories, they will be created as with a
virtual "mkdir -p", and receive the default metadata of
C<$flags{default_dir_fields}> (by default, nothing)  If $path travels through
a non-directory (aside from symlinks, unless C<$flags{follow_symlinks}> is set
to 0) this will throw an exception, unless you specify C<$flags{force_create}>
which causes an offending directory entry to be overwritten by a new
subdirectory.

Note in particluar that if you specify

  apply_path( "/a_symlink/foo", $Dir_Entry, { follow_symlinks => 0, force_create => 1 })

"a_symlink" will be deleted and replaced with an actual directory.

None of the changes from apply_path are committed to the CAS until you call
C<commit()>.  Also, C<root_entry> does not change until you call C<commit()>,
though the root entry shown by L</resolve_path> does.

You can return to the last committed state by calling C<rollback()>, which is
conceptually equivalent to C<< $fs= DataStore::CAS::FS->new( $fs->root_entry ) >>.

Merge all in-memory overrides from L</apply_path> with the directories
they override to create new directories, and store those new directories

=head1 PATH OBJECTS

Path objects are a simple wrapper around a path name array.  Path objects are
lazily resolved to Filesystem Nodes.  This means the path object can exist
even if the node does not, and a path object to "/foo" will continue to be
usable even if "foo" is deleted and re-created.

Most methods of the path objects just pass-through to the Node object returned
from L</resolve>.

=head2 path_names

Arrayref of path parts.  If you created the path object from a path string
like "/foo/bar", path_names will contain the result of File::Spec->splitdir:
C<[ '', 'foo', 'bar' ]>.

=head2 filesystem

Reference to the DataStore::CAS::FS it was created by.

=head2 path_dirents

Returns an array of L<DirEnt|DataStore::CAS::FS::DirEnt> objects resolved from
this path.  Throws an exception if the path does not currently exist in the
filesystem.

=head2 path_name_list

Convenience list accessor for path_names arrayref

=head2 path_dirent_list

Convenience list accessor for path_dirents arrayref

=head2 dirent

=head2 type

Convenience accessor for the C<type> field of the final element of C<path_dirents>

=head2 name

Convenience accessor for the C<name> field of the final element of C<path_dirents>

=head2 depth

Convenience accessor for the number of elements in C<path_dirents> minus one.
The root entry has a depth of 0, C<"/a"> is a depth of one, and so on.

Note that this is counting the resolved path (after symlinks), not the logical
requested path.

Resolves the path, and then returns a canonical unix notation for it.  The
resolved path never ends with '/' because all symlinks have been resolved,

Convenience method for calling L</get_dir> on the file referred to by this

a directory.

Note that this directory object is immutable, from the CAS, and will not
reflect any changes to the filesystem until C<$fs-E<gt>commit> is called.

=head1 TREE ITERATORS

The tree iterators returned by $fs->tree_iterator and $path->iterator run a
depth-first alphabetical pre-order traversal of the tree.  They act as
coderefs (taking no arguments) and return a Path object, or undef at the
end of the iteration.

  while (my $path= $iter->()) {
    print $path->resolved_path_str, "\n"
		if $path->type ne 'dir';
  }

The iterators are also blessed objects, and have a few useful methods:

=head2 reset

  $iter->reset();

Start iteration over from the beginning.

=head2 skip_dir

  $iter->skip_dir();

C<skip_dir> immediately ends the current subdirectory, and the next call to
the iterator will return the next item from the parent directory.

The iterator "begins" a directory right before it returns it to you.  So, you
can prevent entering a directory like this:

  my $path= $iter->();
  if ($path->type eq 'dir' && !we_want_to_enter_dir($path)) {
    $iter->skip_dir;

=head1 DIRECTORY CACHE

Directories are uniquely identified by their hash, and directory objects are
immutable.  This creates a perfect opportunity for caching recent directories
and reusing the objects.

When you call C<< $fs->get_dir($hash) >>, $fs keeps a weak reference to that
directory which will persist until the directory object is garbage collected.
It will ALSO hold a strong reference to that directory for the next N calls
to C<< $fs->get_dir($hash) >>, where the default is 64.  You can change how many
references $fs holds by setting C<< $fs->dir_cache->size(N) >>.

The directory cache is *not* global, and a fresh one is created during the
constructor of the FS, if needed.  However, many FS instances can share the
same dir_cache object, and FS methods that return a new FS instance will pass
the old dir_cache object to the new instance.

If you want to implement your own dir_cache, don't bother subclassing the
built-in one; just create an object that meets this API:

=head2 new

  $cache= $class->new( %fields )
  $cache= $class->new( \%fields )

Create a new cache object.  The only public field is C<size>.

=head2 size

Read/write accessor that returns the number of strong-references it will hold.

=head2 clear

Clear all strong references and clear the weak-reference index.

=head2 get

  $cached_dir= $cache->get( $digest_hash )

Return a cached directory, or undef if that directory has not been cached.

=head2 put

  $dir= $cache->put( $dir )

Cache the Dir object (and return it)

=head1 UNICODE vs. FILENAMES

=head2 Background

Unix operates on the philosophy that filenames are just bytes.  Much of Unix
userspace operates on the philosophy that these bytes should probably be valid
UTF-8 sequences (but of course, nothing enforces that).  Other operating
systems, like modern Windows, operate on the idea that everything is Unicode
and some backward-compatible APIs exist which can represent the Unicode as
Latin1 or whatnot on a best-effort basis.  I think the "Unicode everywhere"
philosophy is arguably a better way to go, but as this tool is primarily
designed with Unix in mind, and since it is intended for saving backups of real
filesystems, it needs to be able to accurately store exactly what it finds in
the filesystem.  Essentially this means it neeeds to be *able* to store
invalid UTF-8 sequences, -or- encode the octets as unicode codepoints up to
0xFF, and later know to write them out to the filesystem as octets instead
of UTF-8.

=head2 Use Cases

The primary concern is the user's experience when using this module.
While Perl has decent support for Unicode, it requires all filenames to be
strings of bytes. (i.e. strings with the unicode flag turned off)
Any time you pass a unicode string to a Perl function like open() or rename(),
perl converts it to a UTF-8 string of octets before performing the operation.
This gives you the desired result in Unix.
Unfortunately, Perl in Windows doesn't fare so well, because
it uses Windows' non-unicode API.  Reading filenames with non-latin1
characters returns garbage, and creating files with unicode strings containing
non-latin1 characters creates garbled filenames.  To properly handle unicode
outside of latin1 on Windows, you must avoid the Perl built-ins and tap
directly into the wide-character Windows API.

This creates a dilema: Should filenames be passed around the
DataStore::CAS::FS API as unicode, or octets, or some auto-detecting mix?
This dilema is further complicated because users of the library might not
have read this section of documentation, and it would be nice if The Right
Thing happened by default.

Imagine a scenario where a user has a directory named C<"\xDC"> (U with an
umlaut in latin-1) and another directory named C<"\xC3\x9C"> (U with an umlaut
in UTF-8).  "readdir" will report these as the strings I've just written, with
the unicode flag I<off>.  Modern Unix will render the first as a "?" and the
other as the U with umlaut, because it expects UTF-8 in the filesystem.

If you have the perl string "\xDC" with the UTF-8 flag off, and you try
creating that file, it will create the file names "\xDC".  However if you have
that same logical string with the UTF-8 flag on, it will become the file name
"\x3C\x9C"!

If a user is *unaware* of unicode issues, it might be better to pass around
strings of octets.  Example: the user is in "/home/\xC3\x9C", and calls "Cwd".
They get the string of octets C<"/home/\xD0">.  They then concatenate this
string with unicode C<"\x{1234}">.  Perl combines the two as
C<"/home/\x{C3}\x{9C}/\x{1234}">, however the C3 and 9C just silently went
from octets to unicode codepoints.  When the user tries opening the file, it
surprises them with "No such file or directory", because it tried opening
C<"/home/\xC3\x83\xC2\x9C/\xE1\x88\xB4">.

On Windows, perl is just generally B<broken> for high-unicode filenames.
Pure-ascii works fine, but ascii is a non-issue either way.  Those who need
unicode support will have found it from other modules, and be looking for this
section of documentation.

Interesting reading for Windows: L<http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=526169>

However, all this conjecture assumes a person is trying to read and write
virtual items out to their filesystem.  Since this module also provides that,
maybe people will use the ready-built implementation and this is a non-issue.

=head2 Storage Formats

The storage format is supposed to be platform-independent.  JSON seems like a
good default encoding, however it requires strings to be in Unicode.  When you
encode a mix of unicode and octet strings, Perl's unicode flag is lost and
when reading them back out you can't tell which were which.  This means that
if you take a unicode-as-octets filename and encode it with JSON and decode it
again, perl will mangle it when you attempt to open the file, and fail.  It
also means that unicode-as-octets filenames will take extra bytes to encode.

The other option is to use a plain unicode string where possible, but names
which are not valid UTF-8 are encoded as structures which can be restored
when decoding the JSON.

=head2 Conclusion

In the end, I came up with a module called L<DataStore::CAS::FS::InvalidUTF8>.
It takes a filename in native encoding, and tries to parse it as UTF-8.  If
it succeeds, it returns the string.  If it fails, it returns the string
wrapped by InvalidUTF8, with special concatenation and comparison operators.

The directory coders are written to properly save and restore these objects.

The scanner for Windows platforms will read the UTF-16 from the Windows API,
and convert it to UTF-8 to match the behavior on Unix.  The Extractor on
Windows will reverse this process.  Extracting files with invalid UTF-8 on
Windows will fail.

The default storage format uses a Unicode-only format, and a special notation
to represent strings which are not unicode (See
L<TO_JSON in InvalidUtf8|DataStore::CAS::FS::InvalidUTF8/TO_JSON>.
Other formats (Minimal and Unix) always store octets, and then re-detect UTF-8
when decoding the directory.

old backups??)

works great on the small scale but fails badly at large-scale production usage.
(exit 0 sometimes even when the backup fails? chance of leaving the backup in

causing spool directory backups to contain 600,000 files in one directory?
nothing to optimize the case where a user renames a dir with 20GB of data in
it?)
